- Added pytest tests into the tests folder for all components.
    - These are tests that were last updated 12/21 and may need to be
    updated to support new components / file paths.
    - Copied over most of the previous tests and initialized the frameworks.
    - Only the transcription test module reliably works - all the rest of the
    tests will need to be updated.
- Added a pypi directory that will contain scripts that can be run directly when
GailBit is installed using pypi.
- Added fixtures to create test output directory.
