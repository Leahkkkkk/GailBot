- Added pytest tests into the tests folder for all components.
    - These are tests that were last updated 12/21 and may need to be
    updated to support new components / file paths.
    - Copied over most of the previous tests and initialized the frameworks.
    - Only the transcription test module reliably works - all the rest of the
    tests will need to be updated.
- Added a pypi directory that will contain scripts that can be run directly when
GailBit is installed using pypi.
- Added fixtures to create test output directory.
- Loading plugins dynamically from anywhere:
    - It seems that the best solution to install plugins is likely by
    changing register plugins to expect a directory, appending the absolute path
    to the relative path, and importing that way.
    - Test this with the new plugin suite.

DATE: 5/3/22
- Changed controller.register_plugins to expect a plugin directory with a
configuration
- Downloading plugin folders:
    - Folders will be hosted on the HI-lab website, which provides direct download
    links.
    - Utils/download.py --> Added this file, which contains methods to download and
    extract zip plugins. This also contains the urls as a global constant.
    - Only released a method to download plugins from url until the plugin
    urls become a bit more stable.
- Released the changes on pypi as version: 0.0.1a2
- Loading plugins
    - Added a system path append for the directory from where the plugins are
    loaded. This is necessary to load inter-plugin module dependencies.
    Released the changes on pypi as version: 0.0.1a3
